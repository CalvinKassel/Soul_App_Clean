## Session Resumption Protocol

### **If Starting New Claude Session**:

1. **Read This File First**: This CLAUDE.md contains complete context
2. **Check Recent Commits**: `git log --oneline -5` to see latest changes
3. **Review Key Files**: 
   - `src/services/compatibility/` (new matchmaking system)
   - `src/screens/chat/SoulChatScreen.js` (enhanced with matchmaking)
   - `CHAT_MATCHMAKING_SYSTEM.md` (full technical documentation)

4. **Understand Current State**: 
   - Advanced matchmaking system is complete and functional
   - All files synced to GitHub repository
   - Ready for testing, deployment, or further enhancements

### **Current Conversation Context**:
- **User's Goal**: Implemented advanced chat-based matchmaking with sophisticated AI
- **Last Request**: Created auto-save/resume system via CLAUDE.md enhancement
- **Work Status**: Major system upgrade complete, user exploring session management
- **Next Potential Steps**: Testing system, deployment, or additional features

### **If User Says "Continue Where We Left Off"**:
Respond with: "I can see from CLAUDE.md that we've been working on session management and desktop launcher creation after completing the advanced chat-based matchmaking system. The HHC personality system, Harmony Algorithm, and conversational recommendation engine are all built and integrated. We were troubleshooting desktop launcher issues but you wanted to focus on making sure CLAUDE.md properly saves conversation history and context. All major matchmaking features are complete and synced to GitHub. What would you like to work on next?"

### **Conversation Flow Preservation**:

#### **Problem-Solving Progression**:
1. **Desktop Launcher Issue**: Created macOS app bundle but getting "claude code not installed or not in path" errors
2. **User Pivot**: Decided to focus on CLAUDE.md session management instead of fixing launcher
3. **Current Priority**: Making CLAUDE.md a comprehensive conversation preservation system
4. **User's Vision**: Auto-resume functionality that maintains complete context between sessions

#### **User Communication Patterns**:
- **Direct & Focused**: User gives clear instructions and priorities
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: When one solution doesn't work, pivots to fundamental improvements
- **Quality Focus**: Prefers robust, comprehensive solutions over quick fixes
- **Session Continuity Important**: Values maintaining context across multiple Claude sessions

#### **Technical Decision History**:
- **Launcher Approach 1**: Used --resume flag (failed - requires session ID)
- **Launcher Approach 2**: Added environment variables and Terminal integration
- **Current Decision**: Focus on CLAUDE.md as primary session preservation method
- **Rationale**: More reliable than launcher dependencies, works across all environments
